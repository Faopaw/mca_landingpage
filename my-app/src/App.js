            <p>
              For the last 7+ years, we at Mindera have successfully worked with
              the latest technology to develop secure, robust and scalable web
              and mobile applications. We have been fortunate and proud to work
              with some of the most talented engineers in the industry and
              amazing clients. For us, it has always been about the journey, not
              the destination.

            <h3>Our Journey to Mindera Code Academy</h3>
            <p>
              Over the last few years, we have been proud to promote education
              in many ways. We create a culture of autonomy, trust and
              opportunities and we have dedicated education offerings such as
              Mindera School, where we train young people to become Software
              Developers. Mindera Code Academy was born from the organic
              evolution and educational contribution we have given to the
              community. Our ambition is to help those who want to start a
              career in software development. After a successful 1st edition in
              Portugal under the name MindSwap, Mindera Code Academy now goes
              global, and you can join us for the ride in the UK and US.
